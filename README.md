### Mente-Carlo Research Group of CIAE

![Logo](logo_mini.png)

The research group mainly engaged in Monte Carlo simulation of nuclear physics in the early years (1959-1989). Now we mainly study the intelligent algorithm related to Monte Carlo method, the heuristic algorithm of interdisciplinary, and the application in agent-based reinforcement learning environment.


### Interests

Here is a list of the keywords we often refer to

- Intelligent Algorithm based on Monte-Carlo;
- Heuristic Algorithm from Physics;
- Reinforcement Learning

As a research lab, potential members are warmly welcomed to join us. Qualified candidates should have solid background on computer science, electronic engineering, mathematics, physics, or related majors. If you feel interested, please enclose a CV and don't hesitate to [contact us](luomincentos@ciae.ac.cn)!
